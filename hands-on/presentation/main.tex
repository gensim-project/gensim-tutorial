\institute % (optional, but mostly needed)
{
	Institute for Computing Systems Architecture \\

% - Use the \inst command only if there are several affiliations.
% - Keep it simple, no one is interested in your street address.

\date % (optional, should be abbreviation of conference name)
{April 2018}
% - Either use conference name or its abbreviation.
% - Not really informative to the audience, more for people (including

% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution:
	
% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
% 15 and 30 frames, all told.
	
% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
% are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
% enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
% you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
% just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.
