\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{}

\begin{frame}{Recap}
To summarize, we've:
\begin{itemize}
\item Checked out and built GenSim
\item Run some simple simulations using ArchSim
\item Added a new instruction to the RISC-V model
\item Run a binary which uses the new instruction
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

Now that you've had a bit of experience using GenSim and ArchSim, we'll
look in more detail at the individual components of a GenSim model.
